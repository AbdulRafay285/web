## How It Works

The application:
1. Takes user input for any search term
2. Crawls the web for relevant images
3. Displays results in a clean gallery format
4. Organizes images in paginated groups (10 per page)
5. Provides visual feedback throughout the process

## Tech Stack

- Python 
- Streamlit (web framework)
- Custom web crawler implementation
- Responsive CSS styling

Simply run `main.py` to start the local server and begin searching for images! No complex setup required.

**crawler.py**
### Bing Image Crawler  
**Overview**  
A lightweight Python web crawler that retrieves image URLs from Bing Images based on a search keyword. Using `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup`, it scrapes Bing's image results and extracts up to 50 direct image URLs for quick integration into projects or research.  

**Key Features**  
- üîç **Keyword-Based Search**: Input any keyword to fetch related image URLs.  
- ‚ö° **Efficient Parsing**: Extracts direct image links from Bing‚Äôs HTML using regex and `BeautifulSoup`.  
- üõ°Ô∏è **Basic Anti-Blocking**: Includes a user-agent header and SSL context to minimize request failures.  
- üí° **Error Handling**: Returns clear error messages for connectivity or parsing issues.  

**Usage**  
```python
from crawler import WebCrawler

crawler = WebCrawler()
results = crawler.search_images("mountains")  # Replace with your keyword

# Print fetched URLs  
for url in results:  
    print(url)  
```  

**Dependencies**  
- Python 3.x  
- `beautifulsoup4` (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)  
- `lxml` or built-in `html.parser`
